# Classes and interfaces

Classes are blueprints for objects. They allow us to define how objects should look like.
eg: which data the should hold(properties), which methods they should have.

So that we can easily build objects, based on these classes. which are called instances of that class

Classes make creation of multiple, similar objects much easier.

creating classes its an alternative to using object literals
